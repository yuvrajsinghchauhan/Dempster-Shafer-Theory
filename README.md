# Dempster-Shafer-Theory
Dempster-Shafer Theory is a mathematical theory of evidence, offers an alternative to traditional 
probabilistic theory for the mathematical representation of uncertainty. The significant innovation of 
this framework is that it allows for the allocation of a probability mass to sets or intervals as opposed 
to mutually exclusive singletons. D-S is a potentially valuable tool for the evaluation of risk and 
reliability in engineering applications when it is not possible to obtain a precise measurement from 
experiments, or when knowledge is obtained from expert elicitation. An important aspect of D-S 
theory is the combination of evidence obtained from multiple sources and the modelling of conflict 
between them.
